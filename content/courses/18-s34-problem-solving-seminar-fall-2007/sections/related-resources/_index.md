For those with some experience with proof-oriented math competitions, the first best step towards training for the Putnam is trying some questions from prior exams, to get used to the somewhat different style of the questions.

The best sources for past exam problems, with solutions and additional discussion, are the three Putnam books published by the {{% resource_link "f3aee1b9-90b7-4216-abba-79fcd7a27928" "Mathematical Association of America" %}}.
