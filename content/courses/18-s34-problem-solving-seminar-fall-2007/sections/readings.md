Several hundred problems and solutions in the four areas (a) arithmetic and combinatorics, (b) inequalities, (c) sequences and series, and (d) real functions. Difficulty ranges from easy to absurd. Includes some famous classical problems which are "well-known" but for which comprehensible complete solutions were impossible to find.

An English translation of a famous German classic. Develops the equivalent of a graduate level course in classical analysis (real and complex) based on problem solving. While many of the problems are too sophisticated for contests such as the Putnam Exam, there are still a large number of more accessible problems covering material almost impossible to learn otherwise.
